I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Techmology, Tsinghua university, supervised by [Prof. Zhengfeng Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2uXdu7AAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I obtained my B.Sc degree at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences ([IIIS, or Yao class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)), Tsinghua University.

My research interests are mainly in quantum crypto, quantum computing, or anything that helps explain how to use quantumness in theoretical computer science.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in discussions about my topic or paper.
